# 3D Car Visualization

## Overview

Welcome to the 3D Car Visualization Project! This interactive web application, created for the Volkswagen Hackathon, leverages Three.js to render a realistic 3D model of a car. Designed for educational purposes, automotive design showcases, and as a foundation for more advanced 3D visualization projects, this project provides users with an immersive experience to explore detailed car features in a dynamic, browser-based environment.

## Features

- Realistic 3D Car Model Rendering: High-quality 3D rendering that showcases intricate details of the car model.
- Interactive Controls: Users can control the car’s movement and explore different views and details.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.
- Advanced Three.js Integration: Features lighting, textures, and environmental effects for enhanced realism.
- Car Customization Options: Users can personalize the car model with different colors and finishes, providing a tailored experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You will need a modern web browser that supports WebGL.
- Node.js (for running a local server).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayush-p28/i.mobilothon-4.0.git
   cd i.mobilothon-4.0

3. Running the Application:
- Install http-server (or use any local server):
   ```cmd
   npm install -g http-server
- Running http-server (or use any local server):
   ```cmd
   http-server .
- open localhost:8080 in any browser
   

### Usage

The 3D Car Visualization application provides interactive features that allow you to explore the 3D model extensively:

- Move Forward: Press the up arrow key (↑) to move the car forward.
- Move Backward: Press the down arrow key (↓) to move the car backward.
- Turn Left: Press the left arrow key (←) to turn the car left.
- Turn Right: Press the right arrow key (→) to turn the car right.

### Customization
This project also includes options to customize the car’s appearance. You can modify colors, textures, and finishes to create a unique look for the car model.

### Project Purpose
This project was developed as part of the Volkswagen Hackathon to demonstrate innovative, web-based 3D car visualization and customization. It serves as a showcase of Three.js capabilities in a simulated automotive environment.


Enjoy exploring the 3D car model!
